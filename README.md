# Metroid-Fusion-Recreation
Recreation of Metroid Fusion made in Visual Studio with SDL2. Made as part of my education at Howest Digital Arts and Entertainment.\
This was my first major programming assignment, made during the first year of my education. The code in this project isn't fully indicative of my current skills. Still, I believe it was an important milestone since
I went from knowing nothing about programming to being able to recreate part of Metroid Fusion within 10 months.\
